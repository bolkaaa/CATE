This week there were less changes made in the program as development has started slowing down due to the program mostly being complete, and the fact that I need to work on the project writeup. Most of the changes were minor code cleanups and some interface improvements. Notably, I also improved aspects of the program's design through separating some functionality into dedicated classes, in the case of AudioRecorder. Next week's post will be much lengthier as I return to working on the program more intensely, as the writing gets closer to the completion and I try to make the program as good as it can be.
